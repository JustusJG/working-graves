# Working Graves

Yet another graves mod, I know. Working graves is a fabric mod that allows for the construction of graves that will be populated on player death. That means you can build a graveyard that will fill up as time goes on. Pretty cool huh?

Working graves is a dedicated server mod. __No client version is available__.

## How to use

Follow these steps for success.
1. Place a sign with the text `hic portus animae`.
2. Right click the sign with a soul torch to underline it.
3. Place a barrel/chest under the sign (a 3x3x3 cube under the sign is checked) [optional]
4. ???
5. Die.

You can now go to the grave to collect your items.
